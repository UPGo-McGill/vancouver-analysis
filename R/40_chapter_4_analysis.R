# Reservations and prices collapsed during COVID-19 -----------------------

#' There were 5.1% [1] more nights reserved in Vancouver STRs in 2019 than 
#' there were in 2018—peaking at nearly 4,000 [2] nightly STR reservations in 
#' the summer of 2019.... In March 2020, however, when reserved nights should 
#' have been steadily increasing en route to the summer peak, they instead 
#' collapsed in the face of COVID-19. While total reserved nights from January 
#' to February 2020 increased at a rapid 79.5% [3] compared to 2019, reserved 
#' nights from March to August 2020 decreased 55.4% [4] compared to the previous 
#' year.

#' On August 31, 2020, fewer than 1,172 [1] STRs were reserved in Vancouver. But 
#' the trajectory of STR activity established prior to the pandemic, combined 
#' with the fact that bookings normally increase rapidly through the spring and 
#' summer, suggests that, in the absence of the pandemic, Vancouver would have 
#' been expected to receive 4,186 [1] reservations instead. The COVID-19 
#' pandemic, therefore, depressed STR activity by 72.0% [1], or 3,014 
#' [1] reservations, on that date. In total, from March through July 2020, we 
#' estimate that there have been 355,890 [2] fewer STR nights reserved than 
#' would normally have been expected to occur. The 224,477 [2] total nights 
#' reserved in this time period is only 33.5% [2] of the 670,690  [2] total 
#' that would represent the previous growth trend.

#' Throughout the May-August period of 2020, nightly prices have been an average 
#' of 32.6% [1] lower than expected. Spread across the 224,477 nights reserved 
#' during this period, this means that STR operators collectively earned 
#' $13.6 million [2] less than they would have on their bookings in the absence 
#' of the pandemic.

# COVID’s impact on frequently rented entire-home listings ----------------

#' According to the model, the number of housing units in Vancouver lost due to 
#' commercial STRs reached a peak level since 2017 and the regulations (2,600 [1])
#' at the beginning of 2020. Most of these (2,370 [1]) were FREH listings, with the remainder
#' (220 [1]) being ghost hostels—clusters of private-room listings operated 
#' out of a single housing unit. As of July 2020, the number of FREH listings 
#' had dropped to its lowest amount since we began tracking it in 2016, with 
#' just 830 [2] listings displaying availability and reservations consistent 
#' with historical patterns of full-time STR activity in Vancouver.
