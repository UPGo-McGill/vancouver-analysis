# How many STR listings have returned to the long-term market? ------------

#' Our image matching algorithm recognized 1,380 [1] unique Airbnb listings 
#' which matched with 2,542 [2] different LTR listings (as some units are posted 
#' multiple times) in the City of Vancouver. The matching LTR listings were 
#' emajorily posted on Craigslist (92.4%), with only 7.6% on Kijiji.
#' 51.2% (1,294 [3] listings) were active STRs in 2020, which establishes a 
#' lower bound for the number of unique housing units that went from the STR 
#' market to the LTR market due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
