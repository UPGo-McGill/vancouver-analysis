# Introduction {-}

In October 2020, the Urban Politics and Governance research group (UPGo) at McGill University was commissioned by the City of Vancouver to conduct market research and analysis on the impact of the City’s April 2018 regulations on short-term rentals as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term rental market in the City of Vancouver. The group also investigated the possibility that short-term rentals are returning to the long-term market because of the pandemic. This report will shed light on the following topics: 

- The impact of the City of Vancouver’s STR registration system on the operation of short-term rentals in the City.
- Information about STRs returning to the LTR market during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of listings that have returned; their spatial distribution, size and asking rents; the extent to which they are commercial operations or casual home sharing operations; and whether they are likely to return to the STR market when conditions improve.

Data and methodology are discussed in the Appendix, and all the code used to generate the analysis in the report is available online at https://github.com/UPGo-McGill/vancouver-analysis.
