# Appendix: Data and methodology {-}

The analysis in this report is based on a combination of private and public data sources. The key sources are the following:

- Listing and activity data about Airbnb and VRBO short-term rental listings gathered by the consulting firm AirDNA. This data includes canonical information about every short-term rental (STR) listing on the Airbnb and VRBO (including HomeAway) platforms which was active in the City of Vancouver between January 1, 2016 and September 31, 2020. The data includes “structural” information such as the listing type (entire home, private room, shared room or hotel room), the number of bedrooms, and the approximate location of the listing. AirDNA collects this information through frequent web scrapes of the public Airbnb and VRBO websites. The data also includes estimates of listing activity (was the listing reserved, available, or blocked, and what was the nightly price?), which AirDNA produces by applying a machine-learning model to the publicly available calendar information of each listing. We use this data for our core analysis of the STR market, including our counts of active listings, our breakdown of different listing types, our estimates of STR-induced housing loss, and our estimates of listings which are commercial operations.

- Additional data about Airbnb listings collected by UPGo researchers. This includes information to verify activity and location, and listing photographs which were obtained through web scrapes.

- Data about long-term rental listings on Kijiji and Craigslist. This data includes the geographic location of listings advertised, the asking rent, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the title, and the photographs attached to the posting. This data was collected by UPGo through web scrapes conducted each Monday from March 30 to October 12, 2020. We use this data to analyze the long-term rental market in Vancouver, and to identify STR listings which have been transferred to the long-term market.

- Data from Statistics Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). We use this governmental data to analyze population and dwelling counts, average rents, and rental vacancy rates.

- Data about property regulation of short-term rentals from the City of Vancouver. We use this data to conduct the regulation compliance analysis for the purposes of determining the impact and effectiveness of Vancouver’s STR by-laws.

This report analyzes the City of Vancouver, and, unless otherwise specified, “Vancouver” refers to the city. When other cities are compared to Vancouver, we are likewise referring to the municipalities (e.g. “Montreal” refers to the City of Montreal).

_Data cleaning:_ We process the raw STR data we receive from AirDNA through an extensive data cleaning pipeline, the code for which is available at https://github.com/UPGo-McGill/strr. With the Craigslist and Kijiji data we scraped, we cleaned the dataset using techniques such as string distance, duplicate removal, and outlier filtering, following similar approaches used with comparable datasets, such as Boeing and Waddell (2017) and RCLALQ (2020).

_Image matching:_ We used our own image recognition algorithm to match listings posted both to Airbnb and to either Craigslist or Kijiji. The algorithm converts the sequence of pixels in an image into a string of numbers representing the average brightness of regions of the image, which serves as a distinctive “signature” of the image, similar to a fingerprint. We compare these signatures to each other using the Pearson correlation coefficient. When the correlation is sufficiently high, we repeat the procedure using separate signatures for the images’ red, blue and green colour channels. All potential matches are then individually verified by human observation. The software package we developed to conduct this image matching is available at https://github.com/UPGo-McGill/matchr.

_FREH modelling:_ We define “frequently rented entire-home listings” as entire-home STR listings which are available for a majority of the year (so 183 days or more in a 365-day period), and which are reserved at least 90 days of that year. This is a consistent and conservative way to estimate listings operated sufficiently often that they are unlikely to be their host’s principal residence. But this indicator is slow to adapt to sudden shocks in STR activity, since it incorporates the past 12 months of a listing’s activity. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic caused STR activity to drop dramatically, we wanted to capture the associated changes at shorter timescales than the one year which our FREH concept allows us to. So we developed a linear regression model which predicts FREH status based on three months of listing activity instead of a full year, and which is calibrated both to routine seasonal variation and to a given market’s specific dynamics. All of the FREH results reported here are the results of this model rather than the raw FREH calculations themselves.
