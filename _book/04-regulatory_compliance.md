**Since April 18th, 2018, STRs in Vancouver require a business licence to operate. Listings can only be operated out of a host’s principal residence for periods of time of no more than 30 consecutive days. Frequently rented entire-home listings and multilistings are de facto considered to be non-confirming, according to STR by-law requirements. Throughout 2019, the number of valid licences increased consistently. Out of all listings that were active on the 13th and 14th of October, 39.2% were operating with a valid licence, 28.1% with an expired licence, 6.9% displayed a falsified licence and 20.0% had no licence. Downtown is the area with the most non-conforming listings (532 or 69.2% of all active listings), while West End is the area with the highest percentage of non-conforming listings (79.4%). Listings with valid licences are the ones that earn the most on average per night ($80.82), while listings that do not display any licence are the ones that earn the least ($29.66). In mid-October 2020, 71.9% of active listings were considered to be commercial operations, with only 42.3% of them operating with a valid licence.**

## Short-term rental by-law in Vancouver

On April 18, 2018, Vancouver City Council enacted new STR regulations which limited STR listings to a host’s principal residence, and required mandatory registration of all hosts. Starting on August 23rd up until the end of the month, 2,438 listings were removed from Airbnb’s website since they did not display a licence number in their listing description (City of Vancouver, 2020b). The City started the enforcement against all non-compliant regulators starting September 1st 2018 (City of Vancouver 2019). As previous sections of this report have demonstrated, the enactment of these regulations coincided with a substantial drop in STR activity in 2018, although the market subsequently rebounded. 

Figure 4.1.1 shows, in pink, the total number of listings that were displayed on the Airbnb platform on a given day. The overlaid green is the number of active licences on a given day. Every day, the number of listings displayed on the website is significantly higher than the number of active licences. The sharp decline in displayed listings (pink) in August 2018 is due to an enforcement by Airbnb, which removed 2,438 listings from the platform. The two sharp decreases in green are due to the expiration of licences on December 31st of each year, and a non-immediate renewal of licences by all hosts. 

The year 2019 is certainly interesting in terms of licences: the number of valid permits increases throughout the year, without reaching a plateau, while the number of displayed listings was slightly decreasing at the end of 2019. The percentage of listings operating with a licence was increasing. Between October 1st and December 31st of 2019, a total of 410 licences were issued for no more than 3 months of fall/winter, while the number of displayed listings decreased by 734, even though the holiday period is one of the most lucrative during the year. Regarding the year 2020, the uncertainty induced by the pandemic COVID-19 is certainly the cause of the plateau in the number of valid licences. Between March 14th and the last day of data (2020-09-30), only 306 new licences were issued.

## Compliance status of listings

In order to conduct a regulatory compliance analysis, we scraped the Airbnb website in mid-October, enabling us to get a snapshot of the conformity status of listings displayed then. However, there most likely have been a decrease in active daily listings due to COVID-19, reducing the sample available for analysis.

Figure 4.2.1 shows the listings that were active at least once (either reserved or available) in the last month of data, which is August 2020. The number of conforming listings is slightly higher than a thousand, which means that 39.2% of active listings are operating with a valid licence. A great number of listings are operating outside of conformity, either with an expired (28.1%) or falsified (6.9%) licence, or no licence at all (20.0%). While invalid license (1.5%) displayed an unusual entry for their licence on their listings, a fake licence shows a greater attempt to evade regulations with a licence entry that follows the usual pattern, but is a licence which was never issued.

Further digging into the active listings compliance, we found that 69 (8.8%) of the active entire home listings use a licence that is also used by at least one other active listing.

Some of the displayed listings, but with a calendar blocked for reservation: these are inactive listings. Together with active listings, they represent the displayed listings. Only 28.9% of all displayed listings conform. A greater number do not conform, with 32.3% displaying an expired licence, 6.5% a fake licence, and 25.4% no licence at all. 1.8% displayed an invalid licence. The proportion of non-conform listings increases with the inclusion of inactive listings, since they are not operating their listings, thus making it useless to acquire a licence.

## Geographic distribution of non-conforming listings

The local areas with the most illegal listings in both absolute and relative numbers are the ones closest to downtown Vancouver. Downtown being the local area with the most listings overall, it is also the area with the most non-conforming listings. The area with the highest percentage of illegal listings is the West End with 79.4% of the active listings being non-conform, followed by Fairview (77.6%) and Downtown (69.7%). 

## Daily activity of entire home listings by regulatory compliance

How does registration conformity impact business in the short-term rental market? We analyzed the percentage of nights available as well as the average daily revenue of all active entire-home listings to get a portrait of the impact of displaying a valid licence number on STR activity. The percentage of nights available for the listings by regulatory conformity since the beginning of the pandemic are on the Table 4.4.1. Conforming listings have a low availability on average, with 30.8% of nights available, meaning that they have been either more booked or blocked more than other categories. The table shows that they also have a very high percentage of reservations relative to the non-conform listings (40.5% to 29.4%).

Moreover, average daily revenue is useful to determine whether compliant and non-compliant listings are operating with the same level of success. Table TKTK also shows the average daily revenue of active entire-home listings since the pandemic and since the regulations. Listings operating with a fake licence are the ones that made the most revenue per night since COVID-19, with an average of 61.70$. This must be taken lightly since they represent a marginal fraction of the population. Conform listings earned on average 52.11$ per night since the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than 12$ more per night (31.0%) than the non-conform listings, a significant difference. Listings operating without displaying any licence are the ones that made the least revenue, less than half the average revenue of conform listings. This could mean that guests are distrustful of operators without a business licence, for example. 

The last column of the table shows the average daily revenue in these same listings since the end of August 2018, when the regulations were enforced. Listings with a conform licence in present times have a similar average daily revenue to listings with an expired licence, which gives a clue to the lucrativity of being compliant, for both listings that are currently compliant and the ones that were in the past. On the contrary, listings that are not displaying a licence number have a drastically lower average daily revenue, indicating that operating without some proof of compliance is harmful for business.

Finally, on average, non-conform listings are significantly less reserved than other listings. Also, the category of listings operating without a licence has by far the least percentage of nights reserved since the beginning of the pandemic. It leads to an average daily revenue much lower for listings without a licence. The previous table and analysis implies that operating without a licence is killing business, but displaying a fake licence not much so. Consumers probably do not care to confirm the conformity of a licence on the City of Vancouver’s online platform, or assume that if a licence is displayed then everything is in order, but may be distrustful when no licence is displayed.

## Non-compliance of commercial listings

All commercial operations are per se non-compliant, since one can not operate a frequently rented entire-home listing in their principal residence, or can not operate multiple entire-home listings all out of their principal residence. Even so, we identified 1841 (71.9%) of the active listings to be commercial operations. Of these intrinsically non-compliant listings, 778 (42.3%) are displaying a valid registration number. 508 (27.6%) are operating with an expired licence, 331 (18.0%) are operating with no displayed licence, and 121 (6.6%) with a fake licence. 75 (4.1%) displayed “Exempt” in their licence entry, and 28 (1.5%) are entries which do not follow a usual pattern of licence number.
