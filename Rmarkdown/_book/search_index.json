It is the most reliable means of determining the overall size of the STR market in a location, particularly with respect to change over time. In 2019 there was an average of 3,920 active daily listings (Figure 2.1) operated by an average of 2,550 hosts. These hosts collectively earned $151.8 million—an average of $38,700 per daily active listing or $59,600 per active host. There was also a daily average of 2,490 listings which were visible on the Airbnb and VRBO websites but were blocked by the host from receiving reservations. The presence of these listings can erroneously suggest that a city’s STR market is larger than it is. When these blocked but inactive listings are included, the average listing earned $15,900 last year, and the average host earned $28,100. Finally, there was a daily average of 90 listings that were not located in private housing units (B&amp;Bs, hotels, etc.), which have been excluded from the analysis in this report. All the figures which follow, therefore, pertain to short-term rentals located in Vancouver’s traditional residential housing stock. Active daily listings peaked in August 2017 at 5,080, and have since declined. There were 2.5% fewer listings active on average in 2019 than in 2018. However, host revenue followed the opposite pattern, increasing by 2.6% between 2018 and 2019. The regulations succeeded in reducing the number of active listings, however listings which remained on the platforms are earning a slightly higher revenue than during the previous year. In general, the number of STR listings available in the City of Vancouver peaks during late summer and winter holidays and falling in between these periods (Figure 1.1). There are two major exceptions to this pattern: the sharp drop in activity in the second half of 2018 after the City’s STR regulations began to be enforced, and the March to September 2020 period, where activity has been sharply below the seasonal trend because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (#fig:fig_1_1)(ref:fig_1_1) (ref:fig_1_1) Figure 1.1. Active daily STRs in the City of Vancouver (7-day average) 1.2 STR growth rates Until mid-2018 the number of active STRs listings steadily increased in the City of Vancouver. Figure 1.2 shows the change in active listings and revenue relative to one year earlier, which is a convenient way to remove seasonal variation to identify underlying growth trends. The figure indicates that, throughout 2017 and the first half of 2018, there were almost always more listings available than the previous year. This situation reversed itself in late 2018, and for a year between the mid 2018 to mid 2019, the number of active listings has consistently been lower than the previous year. The previous growth trends then returned until March 2020. (#fig:fig_1_2)(ref:fig_1_2) (ref:fig_1_2) Figure 1.2: Change in daily active listings and host revenue compared to one year earlier (14-day average) Overall, the year-over-year change in average active listings from 2016 to 2017 (12 months) was 17.7%, the year-over-year change from 2017 to 2018 was -6.1%, and the year-over-year change from 2018 to 2019 was -2.5%. In 2020, active listings fell faster thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. The year-over-year change in active daily listings for 2020 so far (January to August) is -15.4%. The growth rate of reservations and host revenue tells a different story. Despite there being fewer active listings in 2019 than in 2018, the number of reserved nights increased by 5.2%, from 0.87 million reserved nights to 0.91 million reserved nights, while revenue increased 2.6%. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue from January to July 2020 is down 43.5% compared to the same time last year. While in 2017 growth of active listings was always positive but weaker than revenue growth, showcasing increased listings revenue, both variables declined in the early summer of 2018, and even fell into negative territory up to fall 2019, due to the regulations put in place. YOY growth then recovered to previous known levels, although revenue was even higher. A strong decrease in growth, in March 2020, of both active listings and revenue is the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. "]]
