<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Active daily listings and annual revenue</h2>
<p>Active daily listings are listings which were displayed on Airbnb or VRBO on a given day, and were either reserved or available for a reservation. It is the most reliable means of determining the overall size of the STR market in a location, particularly with respect to change over time. In 2019 there was an average of 3,920 active daily listings (Figure 2.1) operated by an average of 2,550 hosts. These hosts collectively earned $151.8 million—an average of $38,700 per daily active listing or $59,600 per active host.</p>
<p>There was also a daily average of 2,490 listings which were visible on the Airbnb and VRBO websites but were blocked by the host from receiving reservations. The presence of these listings can erroneously suggest that a city’s STR market is larger than it is. When these blocked but inactive listings are included, the average listing earned $15,900 last year, and the average host earned $28,100. Finally, there was a daily average of 90 listings that were not located in private housing units (B&amp;Bs, hotels, etc.), which have been excluded from the analysis in this report. All the figures which follow, therefore, pertain to short-term rentals located in Vancouver’s traditional residential housing stock.</p>
<p>Active daily listings peaked in August 2017 at 5,080, and have since declined. There were 2.5% fewer listings active on average in 2019 than in 2018. However, host revenue followed the opposite pattern, increasing by 2.6% between 2018 and 2019. The regulations succeeded in reducing the number of active listings, however listings which remained on the platforms are earning a slightly higher revenue than during the previous year.</p>
<p>In general, the number of STR listings available in the City of Vancouver peaks during late summer and winter holidays and falling in between these periods (Figure 1.1). There are two major exceptions to this pattern: the sharp drop in activity in the second half of 2018 after the City’s STR regulations began to be enforced, and the March to September 2020 period, where activity has been sharply below the seasonal trend because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
